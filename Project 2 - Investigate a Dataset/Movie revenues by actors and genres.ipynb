    "Celebrities have a certain charm, some more than others, which makes us want to watch them. In the context of movies, this can - but not necessarily - translate to higher revenues for films and the companies that produced them. This \"charm\" aspect of actors and its effect on the marketability and financial success of movies has been the topic in academic literature for many years.\n",

    "The empirical analysis undertaken in this project aims to contribute to this discussion by examining the TMDB dataset containing data on movies from 1960 to 2017. In particular, this analysis aims to find out if a correlation exists between (top) stars and movie revenues. Another goal of this project is to show (or attempt to show) if an interplay between the actors, genres, and the invested budget correlates with the commercial success of movies.\n",
